# Classic Arcade Game Project

This is my "Classic Arcade Game Project" project at Front-End Nanodegree Program.


## Playing instructions:

This game is played through the following instructions:
* The player starts from the grass field
* It must pass through the field of stones, where there are many bugs moving from left to right in three lanes
* The goal is to reach the water field without encountering any of the bugs where the game wins
* When it reaches the water field, the player wins the game and returns to the original
